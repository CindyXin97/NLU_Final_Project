# NLU_Final_Project
NLU_Final_Project	This is the final project for GA-DS 1012 Natural Language Understanding course at NYU. We plan to implement continual learning with BERT over questions and answers tasks using Elastic Weights Consolidation (EWC).

## The Baseline model
The baseline model is trying to implentment different tasks to show how catastrophic forgetting undermines the performance of the previously learned task. And it's not yet completed implementing. 

## EWC implementation
Now we will implement EWC over BERT.


### EWC demo 
EWC demo is an implementation of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), proposed in James Kirkpatrick et al. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks 2016(10.1073/pnas.1611835114). Trying to understand how the codes works, we studied many versions of EWC implementation over different tasks on bert.
